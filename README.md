## Link to your/teams github branch, where you have done your work

[https://github.com/INN-DGE/GEA2025/tree/awh](https://github.com/INN-DGE/GEA2025/tree/awh)

## What has been done

* Textures
* Multiple texture support (one per render component)
* Text
* Sprite (with sprite sheet animation support)
* Terrain
* Pong and flappy bird demos
* QtMultimedia sound system

## What is ok, fun, easy, great

It was all fun if a bit like redoing old work

## What is hard, boring, confusing

It was hard figuring out textures again but now that is finally done.

## What can be challenges going forward

Will try to implement skeletal animation and make a demo of the final game.

Will also implement the RPG Riad talked about. Technically, both things would have been done by now if time was spent better.
